\title{Calculate environmental distance between presences and projection data}
\usage{
map_env_dist(training_data, projection_data, metric = "domain")
}
\arguments{
\item{training_data}{data.frame or tibble with environmental conditions of
presence used for constructing models}

\item{projection_data}{SpatRaster, data.frame or tibble with environmental condition used for projecting a model (e.g.,
a larger, encompassing region, a spatially separate region, or a different time period).
If data.frame or tibble is used function will return a tibble object.
Otherwise, as SpatRaster object.}

\item{metric}{character. Metric used for measuring distance. Default 'domain'.
\itemize{
  \item domain: Gower distance between presences and projection data. The result is a similarity value that ranges from 0 to 1.
  \item euclidean: Euclidean distance. This metric Z-score standardizes the projection data based on the training data and then standardizes the resulting distance by the maximum pairwise distance within the training data. The result is a similarity value that ranges from 0 to 1.
  \item mahalanobis: Mahalanobis distance. This metric Z-score standardizes the projection data based on the training data and then standardizes the resulting distance by the maximum pairwise distance within the training data. The result is a similarity value that ranges from 0 to 1.
  }}
}
\value{
A SpatRaster or tibble object with the nearest environmental distance between presences and projection data.
So far the Domain algorithm (based on the Gower distance; Carpenter et al., 1993), Euclidean distance, and Mahalanobis distance have been implemented.
For Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances, the result is a similarity value ranging from 0 to 1, where values close to 1 represent high similarity (low distance) and values close to 0 represent low similarity (high distance).
