\title{Calculate data to construct partial dependence surface plots}
\usage{
data_bpdp(
  model,
  predictors,
  resolution = 50,
  training_data = NULL,
  training_boundaries = NULL,
  projection_data = NULL,
  clamping = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model object of class "gam", "gbm", "glm", "graf", "ksvm", "ksvm", "maxnet”,
“nnet", and "randomForest" This model can be found in the first element of the list returned
by any function from the fit_, tune_, or esm_ function families}

\item{predictors}{character. Vector with two predictor name(s) to plot. If NULL all predictors will
be plotted. Default NULL}

\item{resolution}{numeric. Number of equally spaced points at which to predict continuous predictors. Default 50}

\item{training_data}{data.frame. Database with response (0,1) and predictor values used
to fit a model. Default NULL}

\item{training_boundaries}{character. Plot training conditions boundaries based on training
data (i.e., presences, presences and absences, etc).
If training_boundaries = "convexh", function will delimit training environmental region based on a
convex-hull. If training_boundaries = "rectangle", function will delimit training environmental
region based on four straight lines. If used any methods it is necessary provide
data in training_data argument.
If NULL all predictors will be used. Default NULL.}

\item{projection_data}{SpatRaster. Raster layer with environmental variables used for model
projection. Default NULL}

\item{clamping}{logical. Perform clamping. Only for maxent models. Default FALSE}
}
\value{
A list with two tibbles "pdpdata" and "resid".
\itemize{
\item pspdata: has data to construct partial dependence surface plot, the first two column includes
values of the selected environmental variables, the third column with predicted suitability.
\item training_boundaries: has data to plot boundaries of training data.
