\title{Create directories for saving the outputs of the flexsdm}
\usage{
sdm_directory(
  main_dir = NULL,
  projections = NULL,
  calibration_area = TRUE,
  algorithm = NULL,
  ensemble = NULL,
  threshold = FALSE,
  return_vector = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{main_dir}{character. Directory path containing main folder for saving model inputs and
outputs. If NULL function assumes as directory path the current working R session and creates
a sub-folder with the name of 'flexsdm_results'. Default NULL}

\item{projections}{vector. Vector of folder names for future scenarios/different regions/time
periods to save model projections output.}

\item{calibration_area}{logical. If TRUE, function creates a folder in 1_Inputs for storing
calibration area. Default TRUE}

\item{algorithm}{vector. Vector of model names that will be used. Usage algorithm =
c(gam, tune_max, tune_net, esm_glm). If  "all" is used the function creates folders with all
algorithms available in flexsdm . i.e. 'gam', 'gau', 'gbm', 'glm', 'max', 'net', 'raf', and
'svm'. Default NULL}

\item{ensemble}{vector. Vector of methods used to ensemble different models.
Usage ensemble = c("mean", "meanthr"). Default NULL}

\item{threshold}{logical. If TRUE sub-folders "/1_con", "/2_bin" will be created within each
algorithm and/or ensemble folder. Used for storing continuous and binarized models separately.
Default FALSE}

\item{return_vector}{logical. If TRUE function returns a vector with the path to all folders.
Default TRUE}
}
\value{
A character vector with the paths to created folders
}
\description{
This function assists in creating a directory system with different sub-folders to
assist in the organisation of the modelling process outputs.
}
\details{
The sdm_directory function assists in saving workflow outputs by
creating folders (directories) based on user specifications, such as choice
of algorithms, ensemble methods, and model projections to new geographic
regions or periods. The function first creates two folders within the
user-specified project folder, one for model inputs (1_Inputs) and one for
model outputs (2_Outputs). Within 1_Inputs, there are three sub-folders for
users to store model inputs: 1_Occurrences, 2_Predictors, and 3_Calibration_area.
If a user chooses to include projections in their modeling framework, the
2_Projections subfolder is created within the 2_Predictors folder to store
the environmental data for the projection scenarios provided to the
"projections" argument. Additionally, sdm_directory offers users enhanced
flexibility in saving their modeling outputs, giving them offers users the
option to save results from any modeling and ensemble technique presented in flexsdm
