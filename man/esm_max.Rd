\usage{
esm_max(
  data,
  response,
  predictors,
  partition,
  thr = NULL,
  background = NULL,
  clamp = TRUE,
  classes = "default",
  pred_type = "cloglog",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame. Database with the response (0,1) and predictors values.}

\item{response}{character. Column name with species absence-presence data (0,1)}

\item{predictors}{character. Vector with the column names of quantitative
predictor variables (i.e. continuous variables). This function does not allow categorical variables
Usage predictors = c("aet", "cwd", "tmin"). This function only can construct models with
continuous variables.}

\item{partition}{character. Column name with training and validation partition groups.}

\item{thr}{character. Threshold used to get binary suitability values (i.e. 0,1). It is useful for threshold-dependent performance metrics. It is possible to use more than one threshold type. It is necessary to provide a vector for this argument. The next threshold area available:
\itemize{
  \item equal_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sensitivity and specificity are equal.
  \item max_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sum of the sensitivity and specificity is the highest (aka threshold that maximizes the TSS).
  \item max_jaccard: The threshold at which Jaccard is the highest.
  \item max_sorensen: The threshold at which Sorensen is highest.
  \item max_fpb: The threshold at which FPB is highest.
  \item sensitivity: Threshold based on a specified sensitivity value.
  Usage thr = c('sensitivity', sens='0.6') or thr = c('sensitivity'). 'sens' refers to sensitivity value. If it is not specified a sensitivity values, the function will use by default 0.9
  }
In the case of use more than one threshold type it is necessary concatenate threshold types, e.g., thr=c('max_sens_spec', 'max_jaccard'), or thr=c('max_sens_spec', 'sensitivity', sens='0.8'), or thr=c('max_sens_spec', 'sensitivity'). Function will use all thresholds if no threshold is specified}

\item{background}{data.frame. Database with response column only with 0 and predictors variables. All
column names must be consistent with data. Default NULL}

\item{clamp}{logical. It is set with TRUE, predictors and features are restricted to the range seen during model training.}

\item{classes}{character. A single feature of any combinations of them. Features are symbolized by letters: l (linear), q (quadratic), h (hinge), p (product), and t (threshold). Usage classes = "lpq". Default "default" (see details).}

\item{pred_type}{character. Type of response required available "link", "exponential", "cloglog" and "logistic". Default "cloglog"}

\item{regmult}{numeric. A constant to adjust regularization. Because ESM are used
for modeling species with few records default value is 2.5}
}
\value{
A list object with:
\itemize{
\item esm_model: A list with "Gam" class object for each bivariate model. This object can be used
for predicting ensemble of small model with \code{\link{sdm_predict}} function.
\item predictors: A tibble with variables use for modeling.
\item performance: Performance metric (see \code{\link{sdm_eval}}).
Those threshold dependent metric are calculated based on the threshold specified in thr argument.

\description{
This function constructs Generalized Additive Models using the
Ensemble of Small Model (ESM) approach (Breiner et al., 2015, 2018).
}
\details{
This method consists of creating bivariate models with all the pair-wise combinations
of predictors and perform an ensemble based on the average of suitability weighted by
Somers'D metric (D = 2 x (AUC -0.5)). ESM is recommended for modeling species with few occurrences.
This function does not allow categorical variables because the use of these types of variables
could be problematic when using with few occurrences. Further detail see
Breiner et al. (2015, 2018). This function use a default regularization multiplier
equal to 2.5 (see details in Breinter et al., 2018)
