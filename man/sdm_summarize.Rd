\usage{
sdm_summarize(models)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{list of one or more models fitted with fit_ or tune_ functions, or a fit_ensemble output, a esm_ family function output. A list a single or several models fitted with some of fit_ or tune_ functions or object returned by the \code{\link{fit_ensemble}} function. Usage models = list(mod1, mod2, mod3)}
}
\value{
Combined model performance table for all input models. Models fit with tune will include model performance for the best hyperparameters.
