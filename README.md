# flexsdm
This is a provisional version of ENMTML package. Here will be provided new tools and function that will be implemented to ENMTML. The idea of this repository is to recreate the ENMTML package from independent and user-accessible functions. So that there is still a main function that does "everything" but also many independent functions that give flexibility to the original package.
